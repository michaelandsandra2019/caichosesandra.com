                        <h3>Michael Cai</h3>
                        <h4>Groom</h4>
                        <p>Hi! I'm Michael. I am excited to be able to celebrate my
                        wedding this December with so many close friends and family members.
                        Sandra and I met during our college years at New York University (NYU),
                        bonded over our shared love of movies, board games, and asian
                        food, and are now beginning a new adventure in Evanston, Illinois
                        (just outside of Chicago) as I start my PhD program at
                        Northwestern.<br>
                        When I am not thinking about politics and policy, listening to podcasts,
                        or interrupting a conversation with a corny joke,
                        I enjoy playing basketball, and singing and playing guitar and
                        piano. And, as a Houston native, I enjoy a good plate of fajitas
                        or a heaping serving of brisket as much as any other red-blooded
                        Texan, and cheering at the top of my lungs at a high-octane Rockets game
                        outing at the Toyota Center.

                        <h3>Sandra Chang</h3>
                        <h4>Bride</h4>
                        <p>Hi! I’m Sandra, and I am thrilled to be celebrating with everyone in December!
                        I grew up in Taiwan, where I have many treasured memories of
                        biking & hiking in the
                        gorgeous mountains, pigging out & playing games at night markets, and being silly
                        with my friends (I grew up with most of them from 1st - 12th grade given our
                        unique school system).<br> 

                        After high school I moved to the big apple, where I eventually met Michael.
                        My four years at NYU was filled with joy and personal growth, and
                        studying abroad in Sydney, Australia with Michael and friends was definitely
                        a highlight! I will never forget the
                        pristine Sydney beaches and the rolling hills in New Zealand. I stayed in NYC
                        after college and started my marketing career at a Pepsico.
                        Fortunately, I was able to secure a seamless transfer from the NY office to
                        the Chicago office.
                        Although I will dearly miss our NYC friends and all the memories
                        we made together, I am also looking forward
                        to starting a new chapter of life in Chicago!</p>

                        <h4>Best Man</h4>
                        <p>Hi! I'm Kevin. I am a newly minted pastor, and I
                        enjoy having deep conversations and being a goofball with others.
                        I initially got to know Michael through leading a men's bible study with him as
                        part of the Asian American Christian Fellowship at NYU.
                        Following that during our weekly video chats, phone calls, or
                        breakfast meetups, we got to deepen our understanding of one
                        another's greatest hopes and dreams as well as our enduring struggles.
                        <br>
                        I am truly glad we were able to "do life together" over the past six years!
                        The countless nights I've spent with Sandra and Michael, eating dinner and
                        playing board games will always be one of my warmest, favorite
                        memories of the time we've shared. I am looking forward to celebrating
                        their love for one another!</p>

                        <h3>Warren Halliday</h3>
                        <h4>Groomsman</h4>
                        <p>Hi! I'm Warren. Michael and I met in Bellaire high school choir.
                        Through a shared passion for tomfoolery and German speed-singing,
                        our grand friendship was born!
                        During those days, we would watch endless re-runs of SportsCenter
                        while playing pool, record covers of songs, like Baby
                        by Justin Bieber, watch NBA Finals games at Buffalo Wild Wings,
                        and play Call of Duty from dawn to dusk.
                        I'm glad to see Michael finally found someone to keep his
                        goofiness in check!

                        captain and friend) of one of the kindest, hardest working, and punniest RAs at
                        the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
                        This year, I started my PhD at UCLA, hoping to
                        work on issues related to education and labor.<br>
                        <b>For fans of The West Wing, one of my favorite quotes from the show:</b>
                        <i>"Mallory, education is the silver bullet. Education is everything.
                        We don't need little changes, we need gigantic, monumental changes.
                        Schools should be palaces. The competition for the best teachers should be fierce.
                        They should be making six-figure salaries. Schools should be incredibly expensive
                        for government and absolutely free of charge to its citizens, just like national defense.
                        That's my position. I just haven't figured out how to do it
                        yet."</i>

                        I've known “Mandra” since the start of their relationship,
                        when ebola "prevented" Michael from going to study abroad and parting with his love.
                        Since then they have been a huge blessing to everyone around them,
                        and I've just been along for the ride!</p>

                        Can't wait to celebrate with them on their wedding day!

                        I currently live in Boston with my husband and newborn baby boy.

                        I am a potato who has enough energy to power up your house for days.
                        I love the creative arts and hope one day I will be working in a field
                        where I can thrive and empower others. 
                        <br>
                        I met Sandra because she thought we had the same bedsheets!
                        We both dormed in Founders and was in the AACF freshman group.
                        We both enjoy sharing God's love so it was something we connected over
                        and was able to do it freely because we were freshies.

                        I met Michael when I saw Sandra was dating this man!
                        I immediately messaged Michael and said, "You better take care of my bae!"
                        before we even met.
                        I can't believe the day has come where I handover my Sandra to the man who got her heart!

                        How did I meet Sandra and Michael? Sandra was the first person who welcomed me when
                        I initially joined AACF, and Michael was the first person in college I met who also
                        had a nut allergy.

                        <p>Hi, I'm Kaitlyn! In my second year of college, my first impression of Michael was
                        “the guy with crazy-good vocals”, who could always be seen with Sandra,
                        the super-sweet, generous, and open-hearted gal
                        who seemed to always be serving one way or other.
                        They soon went from AACF legends to fast and faithful friends, and being able to
                        grow, serve, and do life alongside them has truly been one of the
                        greatest joys and treasures.
                        To the couple whose love for God and each other strengthens many
                        others—I love you and congrats!! </p>
